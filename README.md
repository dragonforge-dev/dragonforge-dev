- 👋 Hi, I’m @dragonforge-dev and I've been writing code professionally since 1998. I got my start in video games, but have worked in many fields. I'm a big proponent of [Agile methodologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) (with a preference for [XP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) and [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) and [testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing). I'm currently going back to my roots and working mainly in video games.
- 👀 I’m interested in software architecture and videogame development. I prefer backend development to frontend, but I enjoy crafting a delightful user experience.
- 🌱 I’m constantly learning more about [Godot](https://godotengine.org) and modern 3D game development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on things I feel will enhance the game development experience with [Godot](https://godotengine.org).
- 📫 How to reach me: Visit me at [Dragonforge.dev](https://dragonforge.dev) or on [itch.io](https://dragonforge-development.itch.io/) to see what tools and games I've created.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm working on paid tutorials for Godot that will not only help people learn how to create fully functional games, but learn the skills to be a professional developer. In over 20 years of hiring engineers, I've found there are a lot of things schools and coding bootcamps don't teach that are essential to being a good developer.
